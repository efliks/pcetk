Introduction
------------

ContinuumElectrostatics is a module that provides interface to 
the MEAD program by Donald Bashford, extended by Timm Essigke.

Developments are under way to interface the module with the GMCT program
by Matthias Ullmann.

The module is similar in behaviour to the multiflex2qmpb.pl program by Timm Essigke.

For the calculated thermodynamic cycle, see Fig. 3.8, p. 82 in Timm's thesis.

Copying
-------

The module is distributed under the CeCILL Free Software Licence, which is
a French equivalent of the GNU open source licence (GNU GPL).

For details, see the files Licence_CeCILL_V2-en.txt (or Licence_CeCILL_V2-fr.txt).

Usage
-----

For this module to be used, one should in the first step prepare CHARMM
topology (psf) and coordinate (crd) files for the protein of interest.

A pqr file is not needed because the radii are assigned to atoms at runtime.

All titratable residues in the protein should be set to their standard
protonation states at pH = 7, i.e. aspartates and glutamates deprotonated,
histidines doubly protonated, other residues protonated.

Test cases

----------
To-do list
----------

- Move parts of WriteJobFiles to the instance class

- Rename variables containing filenames so that they start from "file"

- Coordinates from the FPT file should have their own data structure?

- Efficiency improvements during partitioning of the system and writing job files?

- Use arrays instead of lists for interactions (Real1DArray or SymmetricMatrix?)

- Have a column of ETA (Estimated Time for Accomplishment) in MEAD calculations

- Optionally convert kcal/mol (MEAD units) to kJ/mol (pDynamo units)
